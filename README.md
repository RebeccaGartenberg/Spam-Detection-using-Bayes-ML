# Spam-Detection-using-Bayes-ML
## project by: Rebecca Gartenberg and Joey Berkovitz

This project uses Bayesian Machine Learning models to classify URLs as either spam or not spam.
Three models including Naive Bayes, logistic regression and SVM models are trained and tested on a list of URLs.
The models are compared based on percent error when classifying the URLs.

The following article explains the data processing, model training and testing: https://medium.com/@rebeccagartenberg1
